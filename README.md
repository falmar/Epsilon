# Epsilon - PHP Framework

Epsilon is a lightweight and lightning-fast PHP Framework, without big limitations or complexity. Easy to use! and you will be able to develop any kind of application on the top of it. Main structure is based on frameworks like Joomla and Yii2

Epsilon was made for developers with broad experience with PHP ready to create and design web applications as they want however they want! Using Epsilon bare bones

Some Features:
